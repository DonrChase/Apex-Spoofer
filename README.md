### This is the best cleaner I've ever made.

So this is a Full Apex Legends trace cleaner. Mostly my friend who wishes to be anonymous sent me this said it was ok if I posted on UC and I said why not. I added some registry files of my own since I saw it was missing but the rest is his work I'm pretty sure.



This deletes and cleans all Apex/EAC/Origin related trace files. This works for origin only I think. There's also some files that you need to manually delete every other game. Some files you won't be able to delete because origin is open but you can delete some files / items within those folders.

The files
```
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Local\Temp - Delete everything from folder
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Local\Origin - Delete origin folder
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Roaming\Origin - Delete origin folder
C:\Windows\Minidump - Delete all dumps
```



NO THIS WON'T GET YOU UNBANNED. THIS IS SIMPLY A TOOL YOU CAN USE IF YOU'RE HWID BAN ALONG WITH YOUR SPOOFER.

***

## How To Use

#### 1- Run the batch file as admin

#### 2- Restart your pc

#### 3- When you go to origin right click on apex > Locate game > then locate your game so you don't have to fully reinstall it.

### Can I play now without getting banned ?

> No. You just cleaned your traces, As explained by someone else (kudos), Its like cleaning

### Spoofing HWID

> After cleaning traces you will have to Change the following HWID serials.
```
Baseboard
Bios
CPU
Disks
MAC
```

There are many free spoofing methods (even permanent ones) google will be your best friend.

### Can't find anything ?

> Then try making a KVM with GPU integration [Use search function â†—)

### Will this unban my account ?

> No, there is no UNBAN TOOL so stop looking for one. Just follow steps explained make a new account and enjoy.
